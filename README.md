## Files

- `text_convert.jl` contains the functions to convert between the julia, latex and macaulay formats for the invariants.
- `invariants.jl` contains the invariant functions with `a` as input vector (CF values from CF table)
- `create_cf.jl` contains the functions to map the CF values from a CF table into the `a` vector
